## The last clue for this puzzle was originally
#
# images/first-east.png
# First East
#
# which provides an example of a picture clue where the image is retrieved
# from the local filesystem. This requires you to have an image called
# "first-east.png" in the images directory in the project root. Since you
# probably don't have this image on your computer, I removed the image URL.
#
# Now, this just provides an example of how you can mix and match
# different kinds of clues.
